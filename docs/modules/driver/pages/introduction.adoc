= What is a Driver

The driver determines how to provide the generated OpenNMS requisition.
It is a required global configuration item for the {page-component-title} server.
The configuration for the drivers has to be specified in the +global.properties+ file.
It is possible to configure exactly one driver for the {page-component-title} server.
For the {page-component-title} server you can configure a global log level.
The loglevel is also located in the +global.properties+ file and can be configured with the following values:

----
loglevel = INFO
----

[options="header",width="25%", cols="1,^1"]
|===
| Level | Default
| ALL   |
| TRACE |
| DEBUG |
| INFO  | *
| WARN  |
| ERROR |
| OFF   |
|===

TIP: Changing the log level requires a restart if you run {page-component-title} as a daemon in _HTTP_ mode.

The driver is configured in `global.properties` which is located in the root application directory.
