= Variable Substitution

The configuration mechanism of {page-component-title} supports basic variable substitution.
Therefore it is possible to add properties to the `global.properties` file and reference the property values in any `requisition.properties` file.
Properties defined in the `global.properties` can be overwritten in a `requisition.properties` file.
It is also possible to use properties defined in a `requisition.properties` in a different part of the same `requisition.properties` again.
An implicit property `requisition` is also available in `requisition.properties` by default.

The following examples demonstrate the use of properties as variables in a {page-component-title} configuration.
With the following configuration Nodes from the link:https://demo.opennms.org[OpenNMS Demo system] will be fetched.
To get the information a authentication is required and provided as a global configuration parameter.
The requisition for this example is named `opennmsdemo`.
