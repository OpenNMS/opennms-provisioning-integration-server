= Quickstart

To give an example we want to provide two requisitions from an poor man's inventory as _XLS file_ (myInventory.xls).
The first requisition has a worksheet containing all routers and the second worksheet has all servers of our network.
This example can be found in `examples/source/xlsExample`.

.Worksheet with Router

In line 5, 6 and 7 there is a router defined with more than one IP interface.
All three interfaces will be manually provisioned.
The private IP interface with _192.168.30.1_ is not used for SNMP agent communication.
The services ICMP, SNMP and StrafePing are forced on some IP interfaces.
For all other IP interfaces you can use the OpenNMS Provisiond mechanism scanning IP interface table from SNMP and the detectors for additional services.
The server will also be categorized in _Backbone_ and _Office_.

.Worksheet with Server

The _OpenNMS_ requisition should be provided via _HTTP_ and we use _OpenNMS Provisiond_ to synchronize it on a regular basis.
We build the following file structure:

Providing the _OpenNMS requisition_ over _HTTP_ we create the following `global.properties`

.Use the HTTP web server
[source,bash]
----
include::example$xls/global.properties[]
----

The HTTP server listens on localhost port 8000/TCP.
We have to create two directories, `myServer` and `myRouter`, each containing a `requisition.properties` file.
Both `requisition.properties` files reference the main `myInventory.xls` file which contains two worksheets named _myServer_ and _myRouter_.
The `requisition.properties` is the same for both requisitions.
It is possible to create different script or mapping steps for each requisition.

.Configuration of the myRouter requisition
[source,bash]
----
include::example$xls/requisitions/myRouter/requisition.properties[]
----

.Configuration of the myServer requisition
[source,bash]
----
include::example$xls/requisitions/myRouter/requisition.properties[]
----

It is not necessary to restart the {page-component-title} server if you change properties files or the _XLS_ file.
All changes will be applied from the next request against the server.
With the given configuration you see the result of the OpenNMS requisitions with the URL http://localhost:8000/requisitions/myRouter and http://localhost:8000/requisitions/myServer which can be used in _OpenNMS Provisiond_.

To get the requisition provided from {page-component-title} automatically into OpenNMS you can configure Provisiond with a schedule.
Create following to entries in `provisiond-configuration.xml` and they will automatically be synchronized every night at 0h:0m:0s and 1h:0m:0s.
