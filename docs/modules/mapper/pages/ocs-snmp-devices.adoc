= OCS SNMP Device Mapper

To use this mapper, configure your requisition config to use +ocs.devices+ as mapper.
This mapper requires a +checksum+ of +4099+.
It validates the IP address of the +snmpDevice+ against the black- and whitelists.
For the election of the default an IP filter can be used.
If the IP address of the +snmpDevice+ is _blocked_ a log message is written and the node will not have any interfaces.
The interface has assigned _ICMP_ and _SNMP_ as services.
The `foreignId` is mapped from the _OCS id_ of the +snmpDevice+.
The `nodeLabel` is provided by the _OCS name_ of the +snmpDevice+.
The assets for CPU and operating system are mapped against _OCS_.
Additionally a link to the OCS +snmpDevice+ page is added to the asset comment field.

== Black- and Whitelists

The OCS Integration supports black- and whitelists to control the selection of the management interface for the node.
OCS itself does not define a management interface, it just selects one ip-address as default and maintains a networks-list for every device.
For the election of the management interface, two IP filters are implemented in the IpInterfaceHelper class.
Both read the black- and whitelist from the requisition configuration folder.
Name them +blackList.properties+ and +whiteList.properties+.
Every line in those files is interpreted as an IPLike statement to offer ranges.

== Default ip-filter

This filter accepts every IP address as valid that is not blacklisted.
IP addresses that are whitelisted are preferred over unlisted IP addresses.

== Computers

The first IP address of the +ocs-networks-list+ that is whitelisted is used.
If no IP address of the +ocs-networks-list+ is whitelisted, the first IP address that is not blacklisted is elected as the management interface.
If no IP address of the +ocs-networks-list+ qualifies, the +ocs-default-ip+ is checked against the blacklist.
If it is not blacklisted, it is elected as the management interface (no interface description will be available).
If it is blacklisted, no interface is added to the node. (+selectManagementNetwork+)

== SnmpDevices

The IP address of an +snmpDevice+ is elected as management interface as long as it is not blacklisted.
If it is blacklisted, no interface is added to the node. (+selectIpAddress+)

== Strict ip-filter "WhiteAndBlackOnly"

This filter implements a strict black- and whitelist approach.
Computers and +snmpDevices+ are handled independently.

== Computers

This mode is just accepts IP addresses that are whitelisted and not blacklisted.
If there are multiple IP addresses listed on +ocs-networks-list+ that are whitelisted but not blacklisted, the first such one is selected as management IP.
If no IP address from the +ocs-networks-list+ passes the black- and whitelist, the +ocs-default-ip+ is tested against the black- and whitelist.
If the +ocs-default-ip+ is whitelisted and not blacklisted, it is elected as management-ip.
If no IP address matches the black- and whitelist, no interface is added to the node.
If the +ocs-default-ip+ is selected, the interface of the node will not contain any additional parameters like description. (+selectManagementNetworkWhiteAndBlackOnly+)

== SnmpDevices

If the IP address of the +snmpDevice+ is whitelisted and not blacklisted, it is elected as management interface.
If the IP address does not pass the lists, no interface is added to the node. (+selectIpAddressWhiteAndBlackOnly+)

== IPLike expressions in lists

In both lists the +IPLike+ syntax can be used to express IP ranges and wildcards.
Follow the +IPLike+ description at http://www.opennms.org/wiki/IPLIKE[IPLIKE documentation].
