= XLS Source

The `xls` reads an _XLS_ spreadsheet file and creates an _OpenNMS requisition_ based on the worksheet content.

| Parameter         | Required | Description
| `source`          | *        | set `xls` to use the XLS source for this requisition
| `source.file`     | *        | path of the XLS file to read relative to the `requisition.properties`
| `source.encoding` |          | encoding of the xls file. Default is ISO-8859-1
|===

The structure of the spreadsheet has to follow these rules.
The source reads from a sheet named after the requisition you are requesting.
The first row of each sheet is reserved for `column names`.
These `column names` have to start with certain prefixes to be recognized.

| Prefixes                  | Required | Description
| `Node_`                   | *        | will be interpreted as node label. It is also used as `foreignId` if no `ID_` header is present.
| `Location`                |          | The monitoring location for the node. When not set, the node is monitored from the _OpenNMS_ server, otherwise from the _Minion_ associated with the `Location`.
| `IP_`                     | *        | will be interpreted as an IP address as a new interface on the node.
| `MgmtType_`               | *        | is interpreted as `snmp-primary` flag and controls how the interface can be used to communicate with the SNMP agent. Valid are `P` (Primary), `S` (Secondary) and `N` (None).
| `ID_`                     |          | will be interpreted as `foreignId` for the node. If no `foreignId` is definded the `Node_` value is used as `foreignId`.
| `Parent_Foreign_Id`       |          | defines the `foreignId` for the parent node. Used for `path outages`.
| `Parent_Foreign_Source`   |          | defines the `foreignSource` for the parent node. Used for `path outages`.
| `Parent_Node_Label`       |          | defines the `nodeLabel` of the parent node. Used for `path outages`.
| `InterfaceStatus`         |          | will be interpreted as interface status. Use `1` for monitored and `3` for not monitored.
| `cat_`                    |          | will be interpreted as a surveillance category. Multiple comma-separated categories can be provided. It can be used multiple times per sheet.
| `svc_`                    |          | will be interpreted as a service on the interface of the node. Multiple comma-separated services can be provided. It can be used multiple times per sheet.
| `MetaData_`               |          | will be interpreted as node-level meta-data with the given key and the default context `requisition`. You can use `MetaData_Context:Key` to specify a custom context.
|===

CAUTION: Please note, that this datasource only allows to specify node-level meta-data.

This source also supports all asset-fields by using `Asset_` as a prefix followed by the `asset-field-name`.
The city field of the assets can be addressed like this: `Asset_City`.
This is not case-sensitive.

To add a node with multiple interfaces, add a subsequent row with the same node label (Node_).
This row will be added as a new interface based on the data from the  IP_, MgmtType_, svc_ columns.

The order in which the columns are arranged is irrelevant. Also additional columns can be present.

CAUTION: Check the format of cells to avoid problems with data like IP address.
