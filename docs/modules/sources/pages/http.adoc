= HTTP Source

This source is similar to the _file_ source. Instead of reading from a local file, it can read a requisition via _HTTP_ from another _OpenNMS_ instance.
The location for the requisition is given by an OpenNMS provisioning ReST URL.
It is possible to provide authentication credentials to be able to consume the ReST service.
