=== OCS Mapper
Mappers are used to map the bifurcated OCS data model centered around `computers` and `SNMP devices` to the unified OpenNMS data model for provisioning nodes, interfaces, services and assets.
The OCS integration provides one default mapper for computers and one for SNMP devices out of the box.
Additionally it provides for script-based mapping via script steps.
The default mappers for OCS are a simple way to map computers and SNMP devices to OpenNMS nodes.

==== OCS Computers
To use this mapper, configure your requisition config to use +ocs.computers+ as mapper.
This mapper requires a checksum of +4867+ to get all required data.
It elects the OCS-Source-IP as management-interface of the node.
The black- and whitelisting is applied against the interface.
If no interface is valid, the node will have no interfaces and a corresponding log message will be written.
The elected management interface is enriched with the interface description, if available.
The SNMP and ICMP services are forced onto the management interface.
Additionally the comment field of the node assets is used to provide an HTML link to the computer page of the OCS instance.
The assets for +cpu+ and +operatingSystem+ will be mapped from the OCS computer too.
The computer name is used as both +foreignId+ and +nodeLabel+.

===== Accountinfo to Category Mapper
The default mapper for Computers supports a mapping between OCS Accountinfo data from OCS to OpenNMS surveillance categories.
To use this feature add the +mapper.categoryMap+ parameter to the +requisition.properties+ file and reference a properties file following this syntax example:

[source,bash]
----
# generic example for a properties file that maps OCS Accountinfo data to OpenNMS surveillance categories
ADMINISTRATIVEDATAFILEDNAME.data=OpenNMSCategoryName

# the Accountinfo for ENVIRONMENT is mapped to the OpenNMS surveillance category "Production" if the Accountinfo value is set to "Production"
ENVIRONMENT.Production=Production
# the Accountinfo for JOB is mapped to the OpenNMS surveillance category "Mail" if the Accountinfo value is set to "Mailserver"
JOB.Mailserver=Mail
----

===== Accountinfo to Asset Mapper
The Default mapper for Computers supports a mapping between OCS Accountinfo data from OCS to OpenNMS assets.
Accountinfo entry values can be used as values for OpenNMS asset fields.
To use this feature add the `assetMap` parameter to the `requisition.properties` file and reference a properties file following this syntax example:

[source,bash]
----
# generic example for Accountinfo mapping to OpenNMS assets
ADMINISTRATIVEDATAFILEDNAME = OpenNMS-AssetName

# The value of the Accountinfo entry "TAG" is mapped to the OpenNMS asset field "region"
TAG = region

# The value of the Accountinfo entry "SERVERRACK" is mapped to the OpenNMS asset field "rack"
SERVERRACK = rack
----

==== OCS SNMP Devices
To use this mapper, configure your requisition config to use +ocs.devices+ as mapper.
This mapper requires a +checksum+ of +4099+.
It validates the IP address of the +snmpDevice+ against the black- and whitelists.
For the election of the default an IP filter can be used.
If the IP address of the +snmpDevice+ is _blocked_ a log message is written and the node will not have any interfaces.
The interface has assigned _ICMP_ and _SNMP_ as services.
The `foreignId` is mapped from the _OCS id_ of the +snmpDevice+.
The `nodeLabel` is provided by the _OCS name_ of the +snmpDevice+.
The assets for CPU and operating system are mapped against _OCS_.
Additionally a link to the OCS +snmpDevice+ page is added to the asset comment field.

==== Black- and Whitelists
The OCS Integration supports black- and whitelists to control the selection of the management interface for the node.
OCS itself does not define a management interface, it just selects one ip-address as default and maintains a networks-list for every device.
For the election of the management interface, two IP filters are implemented in the IpInterfaceHelper class.
Both read the black- and whitelist from the requisition configuration folder.
Name them +blackList.properties+ and +whiteList.properties+.
Every line in those files is interpreted as an IPLike statement to offer ranges.

===== Default ip-filter
This filter accepts every IP address as valid that is not blacklisted.
IP addresses that are whitelisted are preferred over unlisted IP addresses.

====== Computers
The first IP address of the +ocs-networks-list+ that is whitelisted is used.
If no IP address of the +ocs-networks-list+ is whitelisted, the first IP address that is not blacklisted is elected as the management interface.
If no IP address of the +ocs-networks-list+ qualifies, the +ocs-default-ip+ is checked against the blacklist.
If it is not blacklisted, it is elected as the management interface (no interface description will be available).
If it is blacklisted, no interface is added to the node. (+selectManagementNetwork+)

====== SnmpDevices
The IP address of an +snmpDevice+ is elected as management interface as long as it is not blacklisted.
If it is blacklisted, no interface is added to the node. (+selectIpAddress+)

===== Strict ip-filter "WhiteAndBackOnly"
This filter implements a strict black- and whitelist approach.
Computers and +snmpDevices+ are handled independently.

====== Computers
This mode is just accepts IP addresses that are whitelisted and not blacklisted.
If there are multiple IP addresses listed on +ocs-networks-list+ that are whitelisted but not blacklisted, the first such one is selected as management IP.
If no IP address from the +ocs-networks-list+ passes the black- and whitelist, the +ocs-default-ip+ is tested against the black- and whitelist.
If the +ocs-default-ip+ is whitelisted and not blacklisted, it is elected as management-ip.
If no IP address matches the black- and whitelist, no interface is added to the node.
If the +ocs-default-ip+ is selected, the interface of the node will not contain any additional parameters like description. (+selectManagementNetworkWhiteAndBlackOnly+)

====== SnmpDevices
If the IP address of the +snmpDevice+ is whitelisted and not blacklisted, it is elected as management interface.
If the IP address does not pass the lists, no interface is added to the node. (+selectIpAddressWhiteAndBlackOnly+)

====== IPLike expressions in lists
In both lists the +IPLike+ syntax can be used to express IP ranges and wildcards.
Follow the +IPLike+ description at http://www.opennms.org/wiki/IPLIKE[IPLIKE documentation].
