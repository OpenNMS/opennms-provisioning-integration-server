=== JDBC Source
The JDBC source provides the ability to run an SQL-Query against an external system and map the result to an OpenNMS requisition.

[options="header"]
|========================
| Parameter                | Required | Description
| `source`                 | *        | Set `jdbc` to use this source for the requisition configuration
| `source.driver`          | *        | JDBC driver, e.g. `org.postgresql.Driver`
| `source.url`             |          | JDBC URL, e.g. `jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database`
| `source.selectStatement` |          | SQL statement
| `source.user`            |          | user name for database connection
| `source.password`        |          | password for database connection
| `mapper`                 | *        | Mapper script changing the requisition. For no operation use `echo`, apply a Groovy script set to `script`
| `mapper.file`            |          | If set `mapper` is set to `script`, relative path to your groovy script for modifying the requisition
|========================

The following column-headers will be mapped from the result set to the OpenNMS requisition:

[options="header"]
|========================
| Column Header     | Required | Description
| `Foreign_Id`      | *        | will be interpreted as `foreignId` on the node
| `IP_Address`      |          | will be interpreted as an IP address for a new IP interface on the node
| `MgmtType`        |          | is interpreted as `snmp-primary` flag and controls how the interface can be used to communicate with the SNMP agent. Valid are `P` (Primary), `S` (Secondary) and `N` (None).
| `InterfaceStatus` |          | will be interpreted as Interface Status. Value has to be an integer. Use `1` for monitored and `3` for not monitored.
| `Node_Label`      |          | will be interpreted as node label for the node identified by the `Foreign_Id`
| `Cat`             |          | will be interpreted as a surveillance-category for the node identified by the `Foreign_Id`
| `Svc`             |          | will be interpreted as a service on the interface of the node identified by the `Foreign_Id` and `IP_Address` field
|========================

This source also supports all asset-fields by using `Asset_` as a prefix followed by the `asset-field-name`.
The city field of the assets can be addressed like this: `yourvalue AS Asset_City` and is not case-sensitive.

Every row of the result set will be checked for the listed column headers.
The provided data will be added to the corresponding node.
Multiple result rows with matching `Foreign_Id` will be added to the corresponding node.

NOTE: To use additional non standard SQL driver, just drop the JAR files into the `opennms-pris/lib` directory and set the `source.driver` and `source.url` accordingly.
