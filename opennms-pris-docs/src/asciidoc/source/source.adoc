== Source

A Source is used to get the data to build an _OpenNMS requisition_.
Each requisition requires a `source` definition in the `requisition.properties` file.
Depending on the type of the source, different configuration parameters are available.
A JDBC source, for example, has different configuration parameters versus an XLS source.
The existing sources with their respective configuration parameters are described in this section.

A source is configured in the `requisition.properties` for the requisition.
