== Introduction
If you have a large network and discovery doesn't help, it helps to find a source of truth for starting to fill your management system.
The provisioning integration server _PRIS_ is a software which helps you to integrate OpenNMS to single or multiple external inventory systems.
It gives you several steps to integrate, transform, clean up, and merge your extracted data before you provide the data into OpenNMS.
The result of _PRIS_ is the OpenNMS requisition model which can be read from OpenNMS Provisiond.

The service is used to provide an integration point for _OpenNMS_ external inventories or home brew inventories.
With pris the data is normalized to the _OpenNMS_ requisition model and can be consumed from _OpenNMS provisiond_.
It is highly specialized to enrich the requisition model with _SNMP_ information i.e. _SNMP_ interfaces, generic _SNMP_ attributes like system location, system contact, and system description.
Besides that, _Provisiond_ can also run service detectors against IP interfaces and allows to run policies to control the monitoring behavior.
_Pris_ is an instance in front of _Provisiond_, it allows to aggregate information from different sources and manipulate them in a flexible way.

The output from _PRIS_ is provided as _XML_ over _HTTP_ and can be used in _Provisiond_ to import and discover services and SNMP data from.
In OpenNMS a requisition is a set of nodes (networked devices) that you want to import into OpenNMS for monitoring and management.
You can assign in OpenNMS services, detectors and policies to model the network monitoring behavior.
For this reason a good practice is to organize nodes with a similar network monitoring profile in a requisition.
The _PRIS_ components are shown in <<pris_overview>>.

=== Overview

The components from left to right are described as followed:

- **OpenNMS Provisiond**: This is the internal daemon responsible to get nodes (networked devices) into OpenNMS. Provisiond scans for SNMP information, network services and has to model the network monitoring behavior for OpenNMS.
- **Driver**: The driver is the method how to present the data from _PRIS_ to _OpenNMS_. It is only possible to configure _one_ driver per _PRIS_ instance
- **OpenNMS Requisition**: The data model which has to be built inside of _PRIS_. This is the shared model between _OpenNMS_ and _PRIS_.
- **Requisition configuration**: The description of the integration of your external datasource. A requisition configuration defines which source should be used or which scripts should be applied to modify or transform the data before they are provided into _OpenNMS Provisiond_.
- **Mapper Script**: The mapper script is the last script executed before the generated requisition goes to _OpenNMS Provisiond_ through the driver. You can use a mapper script to enrich the requisition, remove nodes or replace OpenNMS requistion node attributes.
- **Custom Scripts**: In some cases an external inventory has its own data model, e.g. OCS Inventory. The script source can be used to map the external inventory-specific model into the OpenNMS requisition model.
- **Source**: This is the specific implementation retrieving the data for from your external inventory.
- **External Inventory**: The inventory from which you want to import data for OpenNMS. It could be a free application like phpIPAM, idoIT, ITIL ticket system like OTRS, a simple spreadsheet or just another OpenNMS instance.

=== Files and Folder structure

The latest release of _PRIS_ can be downloaded from the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-provisioning-integration-server/releases[github release] page of the project.
It is recommended to extract the tar.gz content to `/opt/opennms-pris`.
The examples and the documentation are built based on this file structure.
It is possible to install _PRIS_ in a different directory, but you have to take care about adapting the paths in this documentation.

After extracting the archive the file structure should look like this:

----

<1> This documentation in HTML format; if you run _PRIS_ in HTTP mode you can access the documentation at http://<your-ip>:<port>/documentation
<2> Configuration examples for requisitions for every available source
<3> Default configuration for _PRIS_ to run in HTTP mode on port `8000`
<4> Libraries for the different sources which can be used with _PRIS_
<5> Main application which is started with `java -jar`
<6> Init script for CentOS or Debian systems running in HTTP mode
<7> Wrapper script to run in `file` mode, e.g. as cronjob
<8> Configuration directory for all requisitions to integrate inventories
<9> Default folder for scripts which are used in requisition configurations to manipulate the inventory import
<10> Drop-in for your custom created scripts
<11> Drop-in for default ready to use scripts

_Pris_ needs at minimum two configuration files.
The first is called `global.properties`, and controls the general behavior of the provisioning integration server.
A requisition is just a directory in the application server directory `requisitions` and has to contain a file called `requisition.properties`.
The directory name is used to access the requisition.

You can create multiple requisitions using different sources, by creating a directory for each requisition with a `requisition.properties` inside.
The `global.properties` and the directories with your requisitions have to be in the same directory from which the `java -jar opennms-pris.jar` command is run.
By default we suggest to install your `opennms-pris.jar` to `/opt/opennms-pris`.
If you want to provide the _OpenNMS_ requisitions via _HTTP_ from the built-in _Jetty_ web server as a background daemon, you can use the init script in `opennms-pris/src/examples/opennms-pris`.
